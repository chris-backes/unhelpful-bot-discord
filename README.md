# The Unhelpful Discord Bot

This is a bot for discord. It does nothing helpful.

## Features

### Rock, Paper, Scissors

Typing `!rps [option]` will call the bot and randomly select one of the three options. Wins and losses are stored in a JSON file.

### Responses

It will describe the game of chess (incorrectly) if it detects the word 'chess' and has a random chance to reply. 

## Downloading and installing the bot

In order to run this application, you must have node.js installed on your computer.

If you would like to download this and run it in your computer, then:
-   After first cloning the repo, run `npm i` from the terminal to install the dependencies
-   Add a .env file containing the following:

```
TOKEN='[your auth token]'
```

Running the command `node bot` in the terminal will start it up

## Generating your token
